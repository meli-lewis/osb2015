## Choose Your Own Adventure

When I was **first getting started** with python and data analysis, someone recommended that I get past the hump of negotiating package management and just download the free, incredibly easy-to-use [Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/).

If you're already pretty comfortable with Python packages ([virtual environments](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) a bonus) you can just use the requirements.txt file in this repo and:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`
